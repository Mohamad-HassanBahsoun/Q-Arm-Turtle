# Q-Arm-Turtle
In Class Activity where we were provided a Muscle GUI library and we had to work with it

**Part 1 Activity** - uses turtle to draw a semi circle 

**Part 2 Activity** - Experiments with the muscle GUI, where when you left click the arms (cursor over either arm) flex, and when you right click they will relax, and each arms reading is printed to the console 

**P2 Activity1** - This is where you can use the arms to control the movement of the turtle, The right arm is used to control the speed of the turtle, and the left arm is used to rotate the turtle in a clockwise direction
